#Ticketing System - REST API Project
This project demonstrates a REST API Ticketing System developed as part of a Backend Web Development assessment. The system is designed to efficiently assign incoming tickets to individuals based on the Round Robin Principle.

#Objective
The objective of this project was to build a Ticketing System that automatically allocates new tickets to users using the Round Robin Principle.

#Technologies Used
1. Python Flask: Used for backend development, REST API creation, and request handling.
2. HTML and Bootstrap: Employed to design user-friendly web interfaces for ticket assignment and management.

#Features
1. Round Robin Ticket Assignment: Incoming tickets are assigned to users in a cyclic manner, ensuring a fair distribution.
2. User Management: Five individuals are created as sample users, each having a unique ID, name, and a list of assigned tickets.
3. Ticket Attributes: Each ticket contains a unique ID, issue description, assigned-to user ID, and raised-by-user ID.
4. Web Interface: User-friendly web pages for assigning tickets, viewing assigned tickets, and managing users.
5. Live Demo: The project is hosted live on PythonAnywhere for assessment purposes.

#Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Flask app using the provided Python script.
3. Access the web interface to assign and manage tickets.
4. Explore the Round Robin logic implemented for ticket allocation.
5. Deploy the project on your preferred cloud platform for practical assessment.
