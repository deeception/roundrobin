Ticketing System - REST API Project
This project demonstrates a REST API Ticketing System developed as part of a Backend Web Development assessment. The system is designed to efficiently assign incoming tickets to individuals based on the Round Robin Principle.

Objective
The objective of this project was to build a Ticketing System that automatically allocates new tickets to users using the Round Robin Principle.

Technologies Used
Python Flask: Used for backend development, REST API creation, and request handling.
HTML and Bootstrap: Employed to design user-friendly web interfaces for ticket assignment and management.
Features
Round Robin Ticket Assignment: Incoming tickets are assigned to users in a cyclic manner, ensuring a fair distribution.
User Management: Five individuals are created as sample users, each having a unique ID, name, and a list of assigned tickets.
Ticket Attributes: Each ticket contains a unique ID, issue description, assigned-to user ID, and raised-by user ID.
Web Interface: User-friendly web pages for assigning tickets, viewing assigned tickets, and managing users.
Live Demo: The project is hosted live on PythonAnywhere for assessment purposes.
