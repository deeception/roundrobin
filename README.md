#Technologies Used
1. Python Flask: Used for backend development, REST API creation, and request handling.
2. HTML and Bootstrap: Employed to design user-friendly web interfaces for ticket assignment and management.

#Features
1. Round Robin Ticket Assignment: Incoming tickets are assigned to users in a cyclic manner, ensuring a fair distribution.
2. User Management: Five individuals are created as sample users, each having a unique ID, name, and a list of assigned tickets.
3. Ticket Attributes: Each ticket contains a unique ID, issue description, assigned-to user ID, and raised-by-user ID.
4. Web Interface: User-friendly web pages for assigning tickets, viewing assigned tickets, and managing users.
5. Live Demo: The project is hosted live on PythonAnywhere for assessment purposes.
